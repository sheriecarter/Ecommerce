<h1>FAQS</h1>


<h3>Was I Charged Twice?</h3>

<p>Your credit card will only be charged once after your order ships.

If you just placed your order, what you are seeing on your bank account is an authorization. This is a common bank practice handling credit card transactions to ensure sufficient funds and account authenticity. This authorization will clear (depending on your bank, usually within 48 – 72 hours.) If you need help speeding up the process, you can contact the issuing bank of your credit card.

Please only click the “Place Order” button once to avoid multiple authorizations.</p>


<h3>I Get An Error Message When I Enter My Shipping And Billing Addresses. What’s Going On?</h3>

<p>If you are receiving an error message, there may be a problem with your credit card information, billing or shipping address. The billing address should match exactly what your bank has on file. Please review all information closely and look for any typos. Also, try re-formatting the names and addresses in your billing information (this often solves the issue).</p>

<h3>My Order Won’t Go Through. What Should I Do?</h3>

<p>If you’re still receiving an error message after reviewing your credit card information, billing and shipping address, make sure you’re using the latest version of your web browser.

Please only click the “Place Order” button once to avoid multiple authorizations.
