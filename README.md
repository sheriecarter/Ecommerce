A link to your hosted working app.
A paragraph-long description (elevator pitch) of your project.

I created a very modern shopping experience. I wanted to have an ecommerce store that allows users to
purchase clothing.

A list of the technologies used.
A list of installation steps for the app itself and any dependencies - how would another developer run your site locally?
All you have to do is run bundle install and start the server!

Link to your user stories - who are your users, what do they want, and why?


Users can login and add items to their shopping cart, then checkout stripe.
My user is individuals who like to wear women's clothing aged between 16-27.

Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application.
Link to your entity relationship diagrams – plan out your data relationships before coding.

#Stripe
To see Checkout in action, click the button below, filling in the resulting form with:
Any random, syntactically valid email address (the more random, the better)
One of Stripe's test card numbers, such as 4242424242424242
Any three digit CVC code
Any expiration date in the future
Any billing postal code, such as 12345

Pay with Card

#Future Features

In the future I would like to allow users to be able to comment on clothing items as well as have a wishlist of items that they can share on social media.
